python,BAN-B309,Use of `HTTPSConnection` may not be secure in Python versions < 2.7.9,major,security,"Use of `HTTPSConnection` on older versions of Python prior to 2.7.9 and 3.4.3 does not provide many of the assurances one would expect when using SSL and leaves connections open to potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

A secure SSL session relies on validation of a `X.509 certificate`. Basic checks include:
- Certificate Authority trust verification
- Certificate revocation status
- Certificate expiration
- Certificate subject name matching

The `HTTPSConnection` class is used in a large number of locations and fails to check that certificates are signed by a valid authority. Without that check in place, the subsequent checks (some highlighted above) are largely invalid. The result is that an attacker who has access to the network traffic between two endpoints relying on HTTPSConnection can trivially create a certificate that will be accepted by HTTPSConnection as valid - allowing the attacker to intercept, read and modify traffic that should be encrypted by SSL.

In the expression `a == b`, if `a.__eq__(b)` returns `NotImplemented`, then Python tries `b.__eq__(a)`. If `b` knows enough to return `True` or `False`, then the expression can succeed. If it doesn't, then the runtime will fall back to the built-in behavior (which is based on identity for `==` and `!=`).

python,PYL-C0205,"Slots are recommended to be an iterable, simple string detected",major,style,"While it's technically correct to have simple strings as slot values, it is recommended to use an iterable like a `tuple` or a `list`. It's very common to add more than one property names in the slots, and even if there's one property name at the present, having that as a one-member iterable is more clear than a string.

This is a convention and helps it easier to understand and extend your code."

python,PYL-C1801,Built-in function `len` used as condition,major,performance,"Using the `len` function to check if a sequence is empty is not idiomatic and can be less performant than checking for truthness of the sequence. 

`len` doesn't know the context in which it is called, so if computing the length means traversing the entire sequence, it must; it doesn't know that the result is just being compared to 0. Computing the boolean value can stop after it sees the first element, regardless of how long the sequence actually is."
python,PYL-E0100,`init` method converted to generator,critical,bug-risk,"The `__init__()` method is required to return nothing, but a `yield` statement in its body was detected. This will raise a `TypeError` on Python 2.7 and 3.x."

python,PYL-E0202,Method hidden,major,bug-risk,"When a method is defined in a child class which has the same name as an attribute in the ancestor class, the attribute in the ancestor class takes precedence and hides the method."
python,PYL-E0203,Member of class accessed before definition,critical,bug-risk,"A member of a class is being accessed before its definition. This can cause an error while execution.

There can be cases when the member is initialized dynamically or using unconventional methods, like setting a value in the `locals()` dictionary, or using `__setattr__` on an object. Doing so affects readability and is generally not recommended. In such cases, either change the approach, or ignore this issue explicitly for this file."

python,PYL-E0237,Assigning to an attribute not defined in class `slots`,critical,bug-risk,Assigning to an attribute not defined in the class slots will cause an error.
python,PYL-E0238,Invalid slots object,critical,bug-risk,"An invalid slots value is found in class. Only a string, an iterable or a sequence is permitted. This is an error."
python,PYL-E0239,Inheritence is not from a class,critical,bug-risk,Python classes can only inherit from a class. Inheriting from any other object is an error.
python,PYL-E0240,Inconsistent method resolution order,critical,bug-risk,"The order in which other classes are specified for inheritence in a class matters. Python classes use the C3 linearization method to determine a method resolution ordering for each class, which ensures that for a class C, if a class C1 precedes a class C2 in the MRO of C then C1 should also precede C2 in the MRO of all subclasses of C."
python,PYL-E0241,Class has duplicate bases,critical,bug-risk,A class must not specify inheritance from another class more than one times. Duplicate base classes will raise a `TypeError`.

python,PYL-E0702,Object of unsupported type raised,critical,bug-risk,"Raising objects other than a class, an instance or a string can cause a `TypeError`.

There can be cases where the value being raised is dynamically set. One common example is setting the value to `None` originally, and then assigning other objects to it based on a condition. Doing so can affect readability, and is generally not recommended. In such cases, either re-write the block, or ignore the issue for this file."
python,PYL-E0703,"Exception context set to something which is not an exception, nor None",critical,bug-risk,"The syntax `raise ... from ...` can be used only when the exception context is an exception, or `None`. Trying to do so with other object types is an error."
python,PYL-E0704,The raise statement is not inside an except clause,critical,bug-risk,"A bare raise is used inside something which is not an `except` clause. This generates an error, since there are no active exceptions to be re-raised. An exception to this rule is represented by a bare raise inside a `finally` clause, which might work, as long as an exception is raised inside the `try` block, but it is nevertheless a code smell that must not be relied upon."

python,PYL-W0108,Unnecessary lambda expression,major,antipattern,A lambda that calls a function without modifying any of its parameters is unnecessary. Python functions are first class objects and can be passed around in the same way as the resulting lambda. It is recommended to remove the lambda and use the function directly.
python,PYL-W0109,Duplicate dictionary keys,major,bug-risk,Dictionary expression binds the same key multiple times. This may lead to unintentional behaviour. It is recommended to have unique keys.
python,PYL-W0111,Assignment to a new keyword,major,bug-risk,"Assignment is being done to a variable which will become a keyword in the future releases. This statement, which is working fine right now, will give an error in the next Python version. We recommend you to rename this variable. "
python,PYL-W0120,Useless else clause detected on the loop,major,bug-risk,"When a loop specifies no break statement, the else clause will always execute when the loop sequence is empty, thus making it useless. It is recommended to have the statements under else in the same scope as the loop itself.

python,PYL-W0124,`as` with another context manager looks like a tuple,minor,bug-risk,"This `with` statement component returns multiple values and uses name binding with `as` only for a part of those values, as in with ctx() as a, b. This can be misleading, since it's not clear if the context manager returns a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another context manager."
python,PYL-W0125,Conditional statement used with a constant value,major,antipattern,Using a conditional statement with a constant value is pointless and will always evaluate to either True or False. This might not be what is intended.

python,PYL-W0201,Attribute defined outside `__init__`,minor,antipattern,"Defining an instance attribute outside `__init__` affects the readability of code. It is expected to find all the attributes an instance may have by reading its `__init__` method. If there is a need to initialize attribute via sub-initialization methods, it is recommended to assign attributes to `None` in the __init__ then call the sub-initialization methods."
python,PYL-W0211,Bad `staticmethod` argument detected,major,bug-risk,"It is customary for instance or class methods to take `self` or `cls`, respectively, as their first arguments, a method that uses either of these names but is found to be a static method may have been defined incorrectly. Choose names other than `self` or `cls` for arguments to avoid confusing other programmers looking at your code."
python,PYL-W0212,Protected member accessed from outside outside the class,minor,bug-risk,"Accessing a protected member (a member prefixed with `_`) of a class from outside that class is not recommended, since the creator of that class did not intend this member to be exposed. If accesing this attribute outside of the class is absolutely needed, refactor it such that it becomes part of the public interface of the class."
python,PYL-W0221,Parameters mismatch in overriden method,major,bug-risk,"Python will allow this, but if the overridden method is intended to be executed from an external code, you may want to reconsider this.
Overriding a method without ensuring that both methods accept the same number and type of parameters has the potential to cause an error when the overriding method is called with a number of parameters that is legal for the overridden method.

python,PYL-W0603,`global` statement detected,major,antipattern,"It is recommended not to use `global` statement unless it is really necessary. Global variables are dangerous because they can be simultaneously accessed from multiple sections of a program. This frequently results in bugs.

In Python 3.0, the `cmp` parameter was removed entirely (as part of a larger effort to simplify and unify the language, eliminating the conflict between rich comparisons and the `__cmp__` methods)."
python,PYL-W1641,Defining equality for a class without also defining hashability,major,bug-risk,"In order to conform to the object model, classes that define their own equality method should also define their own hash method, or be unhashable. If the hash method is not defined then the hash of the super class is used. This is unlikely to result in the expected behavior.

A class can be made unhashable by setting its `__hash__` attribute to None.

In Python 3, if you define a class-level equality method and omit a `__hash__` method then the class is automatically marked as unhashable.

It is recommended to implement a `__hash__` method or set `__hash__ = None`, whenever you define an `__eq__` method for a class."

python,PAP-W0022,Illegal operation on file,major,bug-risk,Trying to write on a file which is opened in read mode will give an `IOError`. It is recommended to open file in the appropriate mode.
python,PAP-W0009,Multiple return types found in function,major,antipattern,"Returning objects of different types from a function can lead to problems that are difficult to debug. Instead, it is better to raise an exception that can be caught where the function is called."
python,PAP-W0010,File opened without the `with` statement,critical,antipattern,Opening a file using `with` statement is preferred as function `open` implements the context manager protocol that release the resource when it is outside of the `with` block. Not doing so requires you to manually release the resource.
python,PAP-W0011,Use `items()` to iterate over a dictionary,major,antipattern,"The preferred way to iterate over the key-value pairs of a dictionary is to declare two variables in a for loop, and then call `dictionary.items()` (or `dictionary.iteritems()` for Python2), where dictionary is the name of your variable representing a dictionary.'"
python,PAP-W0012,Use `get()` method to access values from a dictionary,major,performance,"In case of checking if key exists in the dictionary and then fetching the value, it is recommended to use the built-in method `dict.get(key[, default])`. This returns the respective value if key exists in the dictionary, else returns a default value, avoiding the dictionary lookup twice."

The inbuilt functions `all()` and `any()` in python also support short-circuiting, but this behaviour is lost if you use comprehension. This affects the performance. "
python,PAP-W0017,Redundant call,major,antipattern,"It is unnecessary to use e.g. `list` around list comprehension since it is equivalent without it.
Same goes for `set` and `dictionary` comprehensions."
python,PAP-W0018,Unnecessary literal,minor,antipattern,"It is unnecessary to use a `list` or `tuple` literal within a call to `tuple`, `list`, `set`, or `dict` since there is literal syntax for  these types."
python,PAP-W0019,Unnecessary call,minor,antipattern,"It is slower to call e.g. `dict()` than using the empty literal, because the name dict must be looked up in the global scope in case it has been rebound. Same for the other two basic types `list()` and `tuple()`."
python,PAP-W0020,Unnecessary typecast,minor,antipattern,Object is being type casted to the same type. This is unnecessary.
python,BAN-W1003,Audit required: Insecure hash function,major,security,"MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1 signature algorithms are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. Attackers can exploit this to generate another certificate with the same digital signature, allowing them to masquerade as the affected service."
python,BAN-W1004,Audit required: Insecure cipher,major,security,Cipher used is not secure. It is recommended to replace with a known secure cipher such as AES.
python,BAN-W1005,Audit required: Insecure cipher mode,major,security,"Use of insecure cipher mode such as `ECB` is not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols at all.

In case of `ECB`, it encrypts identical plaintext blocks into identical ciphertext blocks; and does not hide data patterns well. In some senses, it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality.

python,PYL-W5198,New column added in database with a default value,major,performance,The prefered way is to add a new DB column with `null=True` because it will be created instantly and then possibly populate the table with the desired default values. Adding a default value will lead to a performance issue if the existing table has a large number of rows.

python,PYL-R5102,`HttpResponse()` returns `application/json` content type,major,antipattern,"It is recommended to use `JsonResponse` to return JSON content.
`HttpResponse(content_type='application/json)` can be replaced with just `JsonResponse()`."
python,PYL-R5103,Redundant `content_type` parameter for `JsonResponse()` detected,major,antipattern,"`JsonResponse()` contains `content_type` parameter. This is either redundant or the content_type is not JSON, which is probably an error."
python,PYL-E5101,Model's `__unicode__` is not callable,major,antipattern,Django models require a `__unicode__` method which must be callable.
python,PYL-W5101,Model missing `__unicode__` method,minor,antipattern,Django models should implement a `__unicode__ ` method for string representation.
python,PYL-W5102,Model has `__unicode__` method,major,antipattern,Django models should not implement a `__unicode__` method for string representation when using Python 3. Use `__str__` instead.
python,PYL-W5103,Model does not explicitly define `__unicode__`,minor,antipattern,"Django models should implement a `__unicode__` method for string representation.  A parent class of this model does, but ideally all models should be explicit."
